Bugs


- CRC is showing up as a join/leave event
- IRC configuration not working/loading
- Slack configuration might be working, but need to check on it more



if slack notificaiton are enabled, a webhook uri is required -- yes
slack can be disabled -- yes




 still need to verify all things CRC
 Then, add mulitplexling slack displatch
 then clean up and document and test
 then add channel switcher stuff (cci bs to general and back, mute unmute maybe)
