Bugs


- CRC is showing up as a join/leave event
- IRC configuration not working/loading
- Slack configuration might be working, but need to check on it more



if slack notificaiton are enabled, a webhook uri is required -- yes
slack can be disabled -- yes




 still need to verify all things CRC
 Then, add mulitplexling slack displatch
 then clean up and document and test
 then add channel switcher stuff (cci bs to general and back, mute unmute maybe)


slack slash command to query the meeting and status of the notifier
Show routes and stuff
Rename callZoomApi


godoc
document zoom api usage
slack client with slash commands

don't print message twice. -- this may be because multiple web hooks are coming in

Have a debug mode to drop all web hook payloads in a directory
