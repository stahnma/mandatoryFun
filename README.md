# Mando Fun

This is the collection tools, daemons, libraries and binaries for collaborating
with your collegues across the internet. 

The primary goal is to be things that are enjoyable to use, but ultimately have
some utility in terms of helping people accomplish something -- even if that
something is just finding something to read or shitposting with haste.

This is early on in its development, so items are rough around the edges.

The collection currently consists of:

  * slack-uploader -> An http server allows for uploads of pictures and once uploaded can be autoposted to a slack channel.
  * zoom-notifier -> A service that notifies slack or IRC when somebody joins or leaves a zoom meeting.
  * slack-emoji-grabber -> A quick utility to grab all the emojis from a slack team.
